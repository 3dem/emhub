Welcome to EMhub's Documentation
================================

EMhub is a web application for data management at scientific core facilities, specially
designed for operations of medium-sized CryoEM centers. It allows the creation of users and
resources (e.g. microscopes or other instruments). It also coordinates access to resources through
applications and bookings, providing full traceability and reporting of usage. Read move about
it in this :doc:`EMhub's Overview </user_manual/overview>`.

Additionally, a REST API is exposed that permits the writing of external scripts to communicate with the
application. This feature allows to write "workers" that can monitor new data collection
sessions and handle different tasks such as data transfer or on-the-fly processing.
