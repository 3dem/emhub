Welcome to EMhub's Documentation
================================

EMhub is a web application for data management in scientific core facilities, specifically
designed for the operations of medium-sized cryoEM centers. It allows the creation of users
and resources (e.g., microscopes or other instruments). It also coordinates access to resources
through applications and bookings, providing full traceability and reporting of usage.
Read more about it in this :doc:`EMhub's Overview </user_manual/overview>`.

Additionally, a REST API is exposed that permits the writing of external scripts to
communicate with the application. This feature allows the writing of 'workers' that can
monitor new data collection sessions and handle different tasks such as data transfer or
on-the-fly processing.
