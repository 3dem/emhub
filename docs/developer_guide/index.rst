Building and Distributing Packages with Setuptools
==================================================

``Setuptools`` is a collection of enhancements to the Python ``distutils``
that allow developers to more easily build and
distribute Python packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other
packages.

Packages built and distributed using ``setuptools`` look to the user like
ordinary Python packages based on the ``distutils``.

Since setuptools no longer serves as the default build tool, one must explicitly
opt in (by providing a :file:`pyproject.toml` file) to use this library. The user
facing part is provided by tools such as pip and
backend interface is described :doc:`in this document <../build_meta>`. The
quickstart provides an overview of the new workflow.
