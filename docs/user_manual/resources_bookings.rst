Resources and Bookings
======================

Resources
=========

Resources are either instruments or services provided by the facility to its external users.
Examples of instruments are microscopes, vitrobots, and carbon coater, among others. Regularly
scheduled drop-in sessions for helping users with their projects can be one of such services.

Resources are a central part of the Bookings or time allocation for Applications. Each resource
can have different booking rules and also exceptions for specific applications.


Resource List
-------------

The list of resources can be reached from the `Resources` link in the left sidebar. The following
page shows the resources in a table where the main properties are listed. This *Actions* column requires
to have admin or manager roles. Resource properties can not be changed by other users.

From this page a new resource can be created. Also existing resources can be modified as shown in
the next image. A new resource can be created as a copy of an existing one if they share some
properties and only some need to be modified.

Bookings
========

Bookings are used to organize access to each resource (e.g instruments, services). After some application have been approved,
users belonging to each active application can book time slots for using different instruments. Some
instruments and applications are required to book only in specific time *slots* enabled by the facility
staff.

Other bookings can be made by the facility personnel to define instruments downtime
or to reserve days for instrument calibration or testing. It is also possible to define repeating
events that will occur with a certain frequency. For example, slots for some group of users can
be defined every other week.


Booking Calendar
----------------

The central page to manage all bookings is the ``Booking Calendar``.
This page shows all bookings for all resources. It is possible to filter what resources
to display by selecting one or several resources in the ``Display`` dropdown list at
the top right corner.

From this page it is possible to operate with bookings in two main ways:

* **Creating a new booking**
    User need to click in an empty space in a given day in the calendar
    or drag over several days if the booking will use more than one day.
    Then a new dialog will appear for :ref:`creating a new booking <Booking Dialog>`.

* **Modifying an existing booking**
    User should clink on the specific booking. If the user has not access to the booking (it is not a manager
    or the bookings does not belong to its lab), the title, description and any other information will be hidden.
    In that case, all other entries should be Read-Only. If the user has permission, then it can
    :ref:`modify the booking <Booking Dialog>`.

Booking Types
-------------

* **booking**

    Normal bookings for using a given resource during the selected time frame.

* **slots**

    These are special type of bookings used by managers. Their purpose is to block some days
    and give booking access only to certain users. The permission is granted via the :ref:`Applications` access
    in the *Slots* parameter in the Admin panel. One or more Applications can be allowed for a given Slot.

    For example, if a slot is created for `Resource 1` and authorization is set to `applications A and B`,
    users belonging to `application C` will not be able to book `Resource 1` in that slot.

* **downtime/maintenance**

    This type of bookings serve to prevent usage of resources that are not available. It also serve to keep information
    about instruments performance and availability during a period.

* **special**

    Free category for marking some bookings as special events, for example training sessions that are not
    going to be invoiced but are not downtime or maintenance.
