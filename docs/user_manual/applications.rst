Applications
------------

Applications are created by external users in order to get access time to the facility instruments.
Different types of applications are enabled by the facility staff by creating application *Templates*.

Templates
.........

Facility staff users (role **admin** or **manager**) can create application *Templates*, which are
basically a form with input fields required for a certain type of Application. Before opening an application
period, managers can create new templates and disabled old ones (that will still be linked to previous
applications).

Read more information about `Templates <https://github.com/3dem/emhub/wiki/Templates>`_.

Applications
............

During an application period, PIs can create an application from one of the available templates.
Then, other PI users can be added to the application and the required information should be provided.
The application can be in "preparation" mode and can be modified as much as needed. Once the application
is ready, it can be submitted for inspection of the facility staff for feasibility and also for
a scientific evaluation by an external committee.
