Projects and Entries
====================

A ``Project`` is an advantageous entity in EMhub that allows grouping and
documenting several types of events (e.g., bookings and sessions) related to a research project.
The complete timeline of a project can be visualized, and from there, one can access
any data collection or other information relevant to the project.

``Entries`` can be added to a project for various purposes. Entries can be customized to
store flexible information and can be used to implement different operations and
associated reporting. Read the following sections for more concrete examples.


Projects
--------

Projects List
.............

An overview of all projects can be seen on the ``Projects`` Page. This list shows helpful information about a
project, such as the number of sessions, images, and data storage used by the project.

New Project
...........

It is also possible to create new projects from that page by clicking on the ``Create Project`` button. The following
dialog should appear to provide information about the project:

Facility staff can create and assign projects to other users, but regular users can only create projects themselves.
In both cases, collaborators can be added to a project, and basic information, such as title and description, can be specified.

Project's Timeline
..................

The project timeline shows all operations done over time.

Entries
-------

Entries allow to document what is happening within a project. Different types of entries can be defined in the system
and used in the projects. This enables the implementation of different policies or workflows for project management across various centers. The following sections show some examples of Entries.


Microscope Request
..................

Users use this type of entry at St. Jude to request access to microscopes. This entry defines
several tabs with parameters that the user will provide depending on the microscope and the type of experiment. The user can upload several images in some tabs to document previous experiment results.

.. tab:: Tab: General

.. tab:: Tab: Support for Krios Access

Grids Storage
.............

At SciLifeLab, this type of entry is used to document where grids are stored.

The information collected from these types of entries is then used to visualize
an overall map of what is stored in each dewar and puck in the facility.
