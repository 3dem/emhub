Projects and Entries
====================

A Project is a very convenient entity in EMhub that allows to group and document events (e.g. bookings and sessions)
related to a research project. The complete timeline of a project can be visualized and from there one can reach
any data collection or other information relevant to the project.

Entries can be added to a project for different purposes. Entries can be customized and store flexible information.
They can be used to implement different operations and associated reporting. Read the following sections for more
concrete examples.


Projects
========

Projects List
-------------

An overview of all projects can be seen from the ``Projects`` Page. This list shows useful information about a
project such as number of sessions, number of images and data storage used by the project.

New Project
-----------

From that page it is also possible to create new projects by clicking in the ``Create Project`` button. The following
dialog should appear to provide information about the project:

Facility staff can create projects and assign to other users, but normal users can only create projects for themselves.
In both cases, collaborators can be added to a project and basic information can be specified such as title and description.

Project's Timeline
------------------

The project timeline shows all operations done in a project over time.

Entries
=======

Entries allow to document what is happening within a project. Different types of entries can be defined in the system
and used in the projects. This allows to implement different policy or workflow for project management from one center
to another. The following sections show some examples of Entries.


Microscope Request
------------------

This type of Entry is used at St.Jude and is the way users have to request access to microscopes. This entry define
several tabs with parameters that the user will provide depending on the microscope and the type of experiment. In some
of the tabs, several images can be uploaded by the user to document previous experiment results.

.. tab:: Tab: General

.. tab:: Tab: Support for Krios Access

Grids Storage
-------------

At SciLifeLab, this type of entries is used to document where grids are stored.

The information collected from these type of entries is then used to visualize
an overall map of what is stored in each dewar and puck in the facility.
